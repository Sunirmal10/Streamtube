# YouTube Clone

## Description
This project is a YouTube clone that replicates the modern UI/UX design of YouTube. It utilizes the Rapid API YouTube V3 API for fetching and displaying video data. The clone consists of multiple pages, including an individual video playback page with similar suggested videos, an individual channel page, and a search feed page. The application also includes a search feature to query for specific videos.

The project makes extensive use of React hooks, such as `useContext`, `useRef`, `useState`, and `useEffect`, to manage state and handle interactions within the application. Material-UI components and icons are used to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
